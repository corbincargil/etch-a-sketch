# etch-a-sketch

## Description:

This etch-a-sketch project is a simple sketching interface that allows the user to make pixel art by clicking and dragging their mouse through the grid. The grid can be reset and the number of rows & columns on the grid adjusted as well. The primary goal of this project was to practice using advanced DOM manipulation to make an interactive web page.

This project was a part of The Odin Project curriculum.

  * Use of event listeners for creating an interactive UI
  * Combining event listeners to create the click and drag effect
  * Changing the attributes of nodes such as adding/removing classes and id's
  * Adding and removing nodes using JS
* The importanct of reviewing code I've written and cleaning/refactoring it to make it more readable and more efficient
* Use of guard clauses in functions
* CSS variables for changing the grid size and CSS styling for the user interface
* Continued practice with Git & GitHub for version control 

## Technologies Used:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
