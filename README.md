# etch-a-sketch

## Description:

This etch-sketch project is a simple sketching interface that allows the user to make pixel art by clicking and dragging their mouse through the grid. The grid can be reset and the number of rows & columns on the grid adjusted as well. The primary goal of this project was to practice using advanced DOM manipulation to make an interactive web page.

This project was a part of The Odin Project curriculum.
