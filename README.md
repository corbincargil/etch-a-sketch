# etch-a-sketch

## Description:

This etch-sketch project is a simple sketching interface that allows the user to make pixel art by clicking and dragging their mouse through the grid. The grid can be reset and the number of rows & columns on the grid adjusted as well. The primary goal of this project was to practice using advanced DOM manipulation to make an interactive web page.

This project was a part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Approach: 

The first step of this project was to create a 20x20 grid of 'divs' using JavaScript and CSS (instead of just hard-coding them into the HTML file). Next, DOM manipulation was used to change the background color of the any individual grid cells that the mouse hovered over. In an attempt to give the user more artistic freedom, another eventListener was used to determine if the mouse button is being pushed down, and only execute the background color change when the mouse was being clicked. This made it to where the user must click and drag the mouse instead of just hovering the mouse over the grid. Finally, some additional features were added such as changing the paint color, adding a reset button, and allowing the user to choose the "pixel" size by adjusting the number of rows and columns on the grid. 

## Skills/Methods Used:

* Advanced DOM manipulation to make the webpage interactive
* Use of JavaScript functions, conditional statements, and loops as well as other JS fundamentals
* CSS variables for changing the grid size and CSS styling for the user interface
* Git & GitHub for version control 

## Technologies Used:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Git & GitHub
* Chrome dev. tools
* MacOS Terminal
* VS Code
